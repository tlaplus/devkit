======= Model-Checking Safety Properties =======

This has been a long journey.
We learned scanning, then parsing, then how to interpret basic constant expressions.
Statements were added next, then we learned to parse conjunction & disjunction lists.
Finally, we learned how to apply operators and move between states.
Everything is in place; it is time to write a TLA‚Å∫ model-checker.
